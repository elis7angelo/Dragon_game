# Dragon game
Game where you choose with which dragon you will play and then shoot fireballs at enemies (_zombie dragons_).  
You choose the dragon you like by clicking right (_red_) or left aroow (_blue_). 
Movement of the dragon is controlled with arrows and shooting with space bar.  
You can play multiple times and it shows the best score every time you die. When you die it also shows your succes score for this game, your current scorre and how many enemies you dodged.

I am open to any suggestions to improve this game. Thanks ;-)
